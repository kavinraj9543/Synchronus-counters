DESIGN OF SYNCHRONOUS COUNTERS
DONE BY - KAVIN RAJ L R(2017105546)

AIM: To derive the logical expressions for the inputs to the flip-flops(JK or D or T)
     in a synchronous counter.

DESCRIPTION: Given the type of flip-flop to be used and the sequence in which the
             synchronous counter should count, the program displays the logical
             expression(s) for the input(s) to each of the flip-flops by using the
             state transition table which makes use of the excitation table and the
             simplication of boolean expression using Quine McCluskey Algorithm.

NOTE: The maximum value that can be counted as a state is 15 i.e., the maximum number of
      flip-flops(bits) is 4. The flip-flop displayed first corresponds to the LSB and the
      flip-flop displayed last corresponds to the MSB.
      The variables for the number of bits are indicated as follows:
      (leftmost=MSB;rightmost=LSB)
      2 Bits - AB
      3 Bits - ABC
      4 Bits - ABCD
